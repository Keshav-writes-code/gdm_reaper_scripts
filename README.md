# ReaPack Repository Template

A template for GitHub-hosted ReaPack repositories with automated  reapack-index
running from GitHub Actions.

Replace the name of the repository in [index.xml](/index.xml) when using this template.

reapack-index looks for package files in subfolders.
The folder tree represents the package categories shown in ReaPack.

Each package file is expected to begin with a metadata header.
See [Packaging Documentation](https://github.com/cfillion/reapack-index/wiki/Packaging-Documentation) on reapack-index's wiki.
